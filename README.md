# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for predicting house prices using various regression techniques. The workflow includes:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Data preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Ensemble methods
- Model deployment

## Features
- 30+ regression algorithms implemented
- Comprehensive feature engineering
- Advanced ensemble techniques
- Detailed model evaluation metrics
- Automated pipeline for preprocessing

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install requirements:
   
## Data Preparation
Place your training data in `data/house_price_train_data.csv` and test data in `data/house_price_test_data.csv`

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb` or execute the Python script:

## Results
The best performing model will be saved as `best_regressor_model.joblib` and a detailed comparison of all models will be saved as `regression_model_comparison.csv`

## Key Features
- Automated data analysis
- Handling of missing values and outliers
- Feature engineering for real estate domain
- Comprehensive model evaluation
- Ensemble methods for improved performance

## Model Performance
The project evaluates models using:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R-squared (R2)
- Explained Variance
- Maximum Error
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
